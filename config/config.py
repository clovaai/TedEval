	<li>A single zip file is expected, containing a set of text files.</li>
	<li>No directory structure within the zip file is permitted, just the set of text files.</li>
	<li>The containing text files should be named as&nbsp;<strong><em>res_img_#.txt</em></strong>, where&nbsp;<em><strong>#</strong></em>&nbsp;is the number of the corresponding test-set image.</li>
	<li>Each text file should contain as many lines as text bounding boxes found. Each line should contain eight comma separated values only. The values should correspond to the coordinates of the four corners of the bounding quadrilateral of the word.</li>
	<li>New lines in the text files should be indicated with the windows CR/LF termination.</li>
</ul>

<p>The submitted zip file is automatically checked at the time of submission, and a submission log is presented to the user along with a confirmation of the submission. The checks performed are the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>That the file submitted is a valid zip file, it can be opened and the contents can be extracted.</li>
	<li>That the names of the text files contained are correct and the image numbers are within the bounds of the test set.</li>
	<li>That each text file contains eight comma separated values per line.</li>
	<li>That the coordinates passed are within the bounds of the image and that the coordinates are in clocwise order</li>
